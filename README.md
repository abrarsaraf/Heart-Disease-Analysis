# Heart-Disease-Analysis

## üìå Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a heart disease dataset using Python to identify key risk factors and patterns associated with the presence of heart disease. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic statistical techniques, the goal is to uncover insights that could support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare. This project demonstrates how data analytics can be used to drive meaningful conclusions in the medical domain and aid in informed clinical decision-making.

## ‚ùì Questions / Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
This project is driven by key questions aimed at understanding the patterns and predictors of heart disease based on clinical data:

1 Demographic Distribution

~ What is the age and gender distribution of patients in the dataset?

~ Is heart disease more prevalent in a specific age group or gender?

2 Risk Factors

~ How do features like cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar relate to the likelihood of heart disease?

~ What is the impact of chest pain type and maximum heart rate achieved?

3 Correlation Analysis

~ Which features show the strongest correlation with heart disease presence?

~ Are there any multicollinearity issues between variables?

4 Target Variable Distribution

~ What proportion of the patients have heart disease versus those who don‚Äôt?

~ Is the dataset balanced or imbalanced?

5 Health Indicators

~ What trends emerge in key health indicators such as ECG results, exercise-induced angina, and ST depression?

6 Predictive Potential

~ Based on exploratory insights, which features may serve as potential predictors for a classification model?
